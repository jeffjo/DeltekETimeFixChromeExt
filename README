This chrome plugin fixes the annoying bug in Chrome which prevents you from looking up charge trees.

The current version fixes charge tree lookup, favorities and vacation time (specific to GTRI).

Also note that the manifest.json contains a matches entry that is specific to GTRI's eTime 
application. If you are trying to use this at another company, try replacing the matches clause 
appropriately.

To install, 

0. Download code to a directory on your machine
1. Navigate to chrome://extensions
2. Enable developer mode
3. Click Load unpacked extension
4. Select folder that contains code


Enjoy! And feel free to contribute!!
